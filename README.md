# Lightcurve classification with an LSTM neural network

This repository contains a project for solving a classification problem of Lightcurves as part of the EAFEXP VI from CBPF.

The notebooks can be run on Google Colab.

## Required packages


```
pip install pandas, tensorflow, keras, sklearn

```

All the necessary code is contained in the `master.ipynb` jupyter notebook as are the results. The best model we trained is saved as `model01.h5` and can be used freely
